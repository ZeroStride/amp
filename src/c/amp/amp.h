/**

 * Main header file includes all non-raw amp headers.
 *
 * See README.markdown for more infos.
 *
 * @em amp is highly inspired and build after POSXI threads (Pthreads) - though
 * only offers a tiny part of its or Windows thread functionality.
 *
 * Most @em amp functions return an return code while they might also set errno.
 * Always check and rely on the returned error code and don't look at errno.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Add include for all non-raw amp headers.
